            <h1>Bitcoin 2021 Is Moving To Miami!</h1>
            <p>
              Bitcoin 2021 will move the biggest Bitcoin event in history to
              Miami, targeting dates of June 4–5, with Jack Dorsey, Chamath
              Palihapitiya, Nick Szabo and Tony Hawk as headline speakers!
            </p>
            <p>
              Our decision to move Bitcoin 2021 from Los Angeles to Miami was
              not an easy one, but given the circumstances regarding
              availability in the State of California, we feel the move is
              necessary this year. The show must go on!
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to moving cities, we are also pushing the conference
              back slightly to June 4–5, so as to allow ample time for the
              second wave of COVID-19 to pass and for vaccine rollout to take
              place. We are more excited than ever about this event, and we’ve
              got tons of big announcements in store. Rest assured that we’ve
              been working our tails off behind the scenes to make this
              conference the most unforgettable experience in Bitcoin history.
            </p>
